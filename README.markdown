median-cut.js
=============

median-cut.js is a JavaScript implementation of the [Median Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_cut) algorithm for color quantization.  Median cut is typically used to reduce the number of colors in an image, for display .  It can be used more generally to find clusters in any 3-dimensional[1] data set.

Median cut is also useful for finding a color palette that "represents" an image.

median-cut.js was created for use in [ColorPal](http://mwcz.org/2012/01/16/colorpal-alpha/).

[1]: median-cut.js was created for use with [R,G,B] pixels and as such is currently limited to 3-dimensional data, but I intend to add support for arbitrary numbers of coordinates.
